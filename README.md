# startup

A simple test project with Node.JS and React.JS

Back:

Both Rest API and GraphQL Server (Apollo) are implemented

API Server listening on : localhost:3001

GraphQL Server is available at : localhost:3001/graphql

Run:

```
npm install
npx start
```

Front:

Redux used for state-management

API end-points are used to retrieve data from server, although we could use Apollo Client to retrieve data from GraphQL Server

Run:

```
npm install
npx run dev
```

Go to localhost:3000 to load the main page

There is a + button up-right side of each Phase section in the main page

You can add new tasks, each task has some buttons for Delete, Done and Undone options
